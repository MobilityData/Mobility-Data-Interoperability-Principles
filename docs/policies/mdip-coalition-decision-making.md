# MDIP Coalition Decision-Making

In order to be considered approved by the [MDIP Coalition](../governance.md#mdip-coalition), relevant documents and policies MUST be voted on by at least ⅔ of the [MDIP Coalition](../governance.md#mdip-coalition members) and be approved by ⅔ of the members who choose to vote.

## Process

A vote MAY be initiated orally at a meeting of the Coalition by any Coalition member or the [MDIP Coalition Coordinator](../governance.md#mdip-coalition-coordinator) (“the Proposer”), but MUST be accompanied by a written call for the vote at which time the minimum voting period commences. The written call for a vote MUST contain a link to any supporting material in question as well as the voting time period, which MUST not be less than 72 hours.  

The [MDIP Coalition Coordinator](../governance.md#mdip-coalition-coordinator) SHOULD disseminate a ‘last call’ for votes between 12 and 32 hours before the voting time period closes.  

The [MDIP Coalition Coordinator](../governance.md#mdip-coalition-coordinator) SHOULD extend the voting time period by up to a week if the requisite number of Coalition members (⅔) have not cast their vote.

MDIP Coalition Organizational Representatives  SHOULD vote on a proposal either orally at a meeting, or in writing to the [MDIP Coalition Coordinator](../governance.md#mdip-coalition-coordinator) and the rest of the Coalition. Votes, especially votes of dissent, SHOULD be accompanied with reasoning and relevant suggestions for “getting to yes”.  [MDIP Coalition Organizational Representatives](../governance.md#mdip-coalition-organizational-representative) may amend their vote at any time during the voting period.

Any member of the Coalition, or MAY request a pause in the voting for an opportunity to discuss the proposal at a meeting of the Coalition. If requested, the [MDIP Coalition Coordinator](../governance.md#mdip-coalition-coordinator) MUST organize a meeting within one-week of the request.

The Proposer MAY withdraw or amend their proposal at any time during the voting period, but votes made prior to any amendment MUST be recast.

## Decision Documentation

The [MDIP Coalition Coordinator](../governance.md#mdip-coalition-coordinator) MUST ensure that [MDIP Coalition](../governance.md#mdip-coalition) decisions are recorded in meeting minutes stored on the MDIP Shared Folder.

The [MDIP Manager](../governance.md#mdip-manager) MUST ensure that [MDIP Coalition](../governance.md#mdip-coalition) decisions:

- Result in relevant updates to the [MDIP Website](../definitions.md#mdip_website) within one week of approval.
- Are reflected in relevant document change-logs.

## Example Process

The following bullets summarize the implementation of the above process for a relatively agreeable change:

1. Updated [MDIP Roadmap](../definitions.md#mdip_project_roadmap) presented to [MDIP Coalition](../governance.md#mdip-coalition) which needs their approval.
2. Proposed document is amended in real-time during the meeting to address concerts of the [MDIP Coalition](../governance.md#mdip-coalition).
3. [MDIP Coalition Coordinator](../governance.md#mdip-coalition-coordinator) calls a vote at the meeting and 10 out of 20 Coalition members who are there cast their vote orally and approve.
4. [MDIP Coalition Coordinator](../governance.md#mdip-coalition-coordinator) disseminates a call for a vote with a link to the proposed document and a time period for voting in 5 days (in consideration that some days that week are a holiday for some).
5. 1 [MDIP Coalition](../governance.md#mdip-coalition) member asks some questions in-line in the proposed document which other [MDIP Coalition](../governance.md#mdip-coalition) members respond to since they were discussed at the meeting.
6. 4 of the remaining 10 Coalition members cast their affirmative vote via email.
[MDIP Coalition Coordinator](../governance.md#mdip-coalition-coordinator) emails a “last call” for votes.
7. 2 of the remaining 6 [MDIP Coalition](../governance.md#mdip-coalition) members cast their affirmative vote via email.
8. [MDIP Coalition Coordinator](../governance.md#mdip-coalition-coordinator) emails a tally of the resulting vote:
    - [x] 16/20 members voted
    - [x] 16/16 voted to approve
9. [MDIP Coalition Coordinator](../governance.md#mdip-coalition-coordinator) and [MDIP Manager](../governance.md#mdip-manager) appropriately document the vote and update relevant documents.
