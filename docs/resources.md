### Longer Overview

Public Transit, and the mobility services which support it, is a critical backbone to our environmental, economic, and societal well-being.  Modern, easily-accessible and well-operated public transit depends on a complex system of operations and customer-oriented technology components which work together.  

Interoperable transit technology systems enable transit providers to plan service which is responsive to rider needs, improve service quality and efficiency, and adapt to continuing changes.  Interoperability also encourages innovation among transportation technology companies while helping them to contain costs.

Released in October 2021 after a collaborative public process, [Mobility Data Interoperability Principles](http:interoperablemobility.org) create an industry-agreed upon vision, definition and direction for achieving interoperability with clear roles and responsibilities. The Principles were collaboratively developed and refined over Summer and Fall of 2021 by dozens of public and private organizations and researchers through a public review process.  

Over thirty public and private signatories have committed to implementing the Principles.  Organizations who are interested in publicly committing to the Principles and their faithful implementation can submit the form found at: [Mobility Data Interoperability Principles](http://interoperablemobility.org).  

The Principles are co-authored by (in alphabetical order) the California Association of Coordinated Transportation, California Integrated Travel Project, Denver Regional Transportation District,  ENTUR, Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, Metro Transit (MN), the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, MobilityData, the Shared Use Mobility Center, the Taskar Center for Accessible Technology, Tri-Met, VIA Metropolitan Transit San Antonio, and Washington State Department of Transportation Public Transportation Division.  

### Shorter Overview

The [Mobility Data Interoperability Principles](http://interoperablemobility.org) provide clear objectives and implementation actions for the public and private sectors in order to make the critical connection between transit technology systems and better service.  Officially released in October 2021 at [http://interoperablemobility.org](http://interoperablemobility.org), the Principles were developed collaboratively by dozens of public and private organizations and researchers and are supported by over thirty signatories, who have committed to their implementation.  

## Announcements

The Mobility Data Interoperability Principles Co-Authors are please to announce the publication of v1.0 of the Mobility Data Interoperability Principles and commitment of over 40 public and private organizations to their faithful implementation. The Mobility Data Interoperability Principles provide clear objectives and implementation actions for the public and private sectors in order to make the critical connection between transit technology systems and better service. The Principles, implementation commitments, and information about becoming a co-signatory can be found at: [http://interoperablemobility.org](http://interoperablemobility.org).
