# Definitions

[**Mobility Data**](#mobility_data)
:   Data used by any mobility technology component to execute its core functions.

[**Interoperability**](#interoperability)
:   The ability for any mobility technology component to exchange data in an [open standard](#open_standard) or schema with other components in that system.

[**Mobility Service Provider**](#mobility_provider)
:   Any organization that transports people or directly facilitates transport (e.g. a public transportation agency, a private tour bus, vehicle share, rideshare, or a non-emergency medical transportation (NEMT) company).

[**Transportation Technology Component**](#transportation_technology_component)
:   Any hardware or software component that is used  to:  

     - Plan journeys (e.g.  journey planning applications),
    Provide mobility information to travelers (e.g. travel alerts, arrival predictions, LED signage, public address systems),  
     - Conduct transactions between [mobility providers](#mobility_provider) and travelers (e.g. reservation requests, ticketing, payments, stop request buttons)   
     - Facilitate the duties of drivers, operators or other on-board staff (e.g. communications hardware or software, Mobile Data Terminals, tablets, driver interface software),  
     - Facilitate the duties of dispatch, supervisory, or scheduling staff (e.g. scheduling software, CAD/AVL software, SCADA, APC), and  
     - Manage the mobility system (e.g. performance reporting, shift selection, non-revenue schedules)

[**Mobility Technology System**](#mobility_technology_system)
:   An assemblage of mobility technology components whose functionality is dependent on another component.

[**Transportation Technology Company**](#transportation_technology_company)
:   Any organization that provides a Mobility Technology Component to a Transit Agency or a Mobility Service Provider.

[**Transportation System Manager**](#transportation_system_manager)
:   Any organization that:  

     - Coordinates the service of multiple mobility providers (e.g. some MPOs, local governments, regional transit providers or state DOTs),  
     - Procures or regulates the services of a third-party mobility provider (e.g. a local city contracting with a micro-mobility service),  
     - Maintains (or funds the maintenance of) physical infrastructure used by transit providers to transport people (e.g. local, state or federal departments of transportation), or  
     - Receives legally mandated reports from transit providers in order to maintain service quality, safety, and efficiency (e.g. utilities oversight bodies, safety boards, or other government or nonprofit bodies).

[**Open Standard**](#open_standard)
:   A specific ontology, schema, or format used by the mobility industry in order to facilitate the consistent communication of information between devices which is:  

     - Free from cost and restrictions to use,  
     - Publicly documented in its entirety,  
     - Actively maintained by an independent organization whose business interests are not actually - and would not reasonably give the appearance of being potentially - impacted by the contents of the standard,   
     - Contains structured releases, versions, or changelogs, and  
     - Has an open community of contributors and users, and transparent, inclusive governance.  

     Examples include the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS), Mobility Data Specification (MDS), OpenStreetMap (OSM),  and General Bikeshare Feed Specification (GBFS).  

[**Proposed Open Standard**](#proposed_open_standard)
  
:    Any specific ontology, schema, or format that:  
     - Meets all the criteria of an open standard,  
     - Has been transitioned to maintenance by an independent organization,  
     - Has at least one stable release as determined by the maintaining independent organization, and  
     - Has not met the standards for adoption as determined by the maintaining independent organization.  

[**Open Standard Compatibility**](#open_standard_compatibility)
:   Refers to the ability of a mobility technology component to publish valid open standards with data stored or handled by the components and to ingest valid open standards.

[**Published Data**](#published_data)
:   Data that is available either at a permalink or via a documented application programming interface (API), access to which may require automatically-generated API keys.

[**Programmatic Access**](#programmatic_access)
:   A method of accessing information in which computer programs are permitted to exchange information and commands rather than requiring human intervention (e.g. APIs, webhooks, and direct database access).

[**Fully Capable Programmatic Access**](#fully_capable_programmatic_access)
:   The ability of transit agencies, other mobility service providers, and mobility technology components to perform by means of programmatic access any actions that human users can perform by means of a graphical user interface.

[**Documented Data Formats**](#documented_data_format)
:   A format that:

     - Is documented in its entirety on a public webpage in human-readable form
     - Is documented in a language-neutral machine-readable format at a permalink in a format applicable to the following categories of schemas:

        - API: [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/)
        - Tabular data schemas(i.e. csvs): [frictionless](https://frictionlessdata.io/standards/) data table, data resource or data package
        - Tagged data schemas: [json-schema](https://json-schema.org/)
        
     - Uses structured releases, versions, or changelogs.
