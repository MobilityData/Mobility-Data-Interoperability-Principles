# Our Vision for an Interoperable Transit Industry

More than ever, meeting the needs of travelers requires the complete interoperability of mobility data used by transit providers and transportation technology companies.

**All people** can, equitably:  

- Discover and make informed choices about their mobility options in scheduled and/or real-time by utilizing the highest possible quality of information with the least possible barriers to accessing that information;  
- Maintain their privacy and security; and  
- Travel with the minimum possible friction arising from accessing data related to their mode(s) of travel.  

**[Mobility service providers](definitions.md#mobility_service_provider)** can:  

- Interface with other mobility providers to meet riders’ needs;  
- Use the best available data to support analytics and real-time decision-making for their planning, scheduling, and operating needs;  
- Select the best available technology and equipment to provide their service without vendor lock-in; and  
- Easily use their data and data from other [mobility service providers](definitions.md#mobility_service_provider) to increase rider satisfaction and improve the customer experience through service efficiency and service quality.  

**[Transportation technology companies](definitions.md#transportation_technology_company)** can:  

- Develop new and innovative approaches to serving the needs of [mobility service providers](definitions.md#mobility_service_provider) and riders;  
- Use widely-adopted [open standards](definitions.md#open_standards) for the transmission of all data that allows transit agencies, other [mobility service providers](definitions.md#mobility_service_provider) and travelers to meet their needs;  
- Easily integrate with other companies’ hardware and software to send and receive planning, scheduling, and operating data; and  
- Quickly identify and resolve data issues with their products.  

**Researchers** can:  

- Affordably access, process, and use data from a variety of [mobility technology components](definitions.md#mobility_technology_component) without having to re-create data processing pipelines or obtain costly vendor licenses.  

**[Transportation System Managers](definitions.md#transportation_system_manager)** can

- Easily access, aggregate, and cross-reference mobility operations and traveler needs data at a system level across transit providers and jurisdictions;  
- Utilize mobility data in the context of land use, population, environmental, and other data to inform short- and long-range strategies and policy; and  
- Support the above visions for other stakeholders.
