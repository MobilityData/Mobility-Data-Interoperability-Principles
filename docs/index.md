!!! warning
    This is currently draft content being used to test the website presentation.  When finalized content is loaded this warning will be deleted. 


## Purpose
The purpose of the Mobility Data Interoperability Principles is to foster a mobility industry where mobility data flows freely and securely between [systems](definitions.md#mobility_technology_system), between operators, and between provider and the customer, empowering [mobility provider](definitions.md#mobility_provider) and [transportation system managers](definitions.md#transportation_system_manager) to provide better service and improving the customer experience.

## Principles
1. All [mobility technology systems](definitions.md#mobility_technology_system) creating, modifying, or consuming [mobility data](definitions.md#mobility_data) should be [interoperabile](definitions.md#interoperability).
2. [Interoperability](definitions.md#interoperability) should be achieved through the development, adoption, and widespread implementation of [open standards](definitions.md#open_standard) that support the efficient exchange and portability of mobility information.
3. [mobility providers](definitions.md#mobility_provider) should have access to tools that present high-quality information accessibly, equitably, and in real time to assist travelers in meeting their mobility needs.
4. All [mobility providers](definitions.md#mobility_provider) and consumers should be able to select the [mobility technology components](definitions.md#mobility_technology_component) that best meet their needs.
5. All individuals should be empowered to find, access, and utilize high-quality mobility options that meet their needs as they see fit, while maintaining their privacy.
