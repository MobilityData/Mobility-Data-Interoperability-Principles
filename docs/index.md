# Mobility Data Interoperability Principles

!!! warning
    This is currently draft content being used to test the website presentation.  When finalized content is loaded this warning will be deleted. 


## Purpose
The purpose of the Mobility Data Interoperability Principles is to foster a mobility industry where mobility data flows freely and securely between [systems](definitions.md#mobility_technology_system), between operators, and between provider and the customer, empowering [mobility provider](definitions.md#mobility_provider) and [transportation system managers](definitions.md#transportation_system_manager) to provide better service and improving the customer experience.

## Principles
1. All [mobility technology systems](definitions.md#mobility_technology_system) creating, modifying, or consuming [mobility data](definitions.md#mobility_data) should be [interoperabile](definitions.md#interoperability).
2. [Interoperability](definitions.md#interoperability) should be achieved through the development, adoption, and widespread implementation of [open standards](definitions.md#open_standard) that support the efficient exchange and portability of mobility information.
3. [mobility providers](definitions.md#mobility_provider) should have access to tools that present high-quality information accessibly, equitably, and in real time to assist travelers in meeting their mobility needs.
4. All [mobility providers](definitions.md#mobility_provider) and consumers should be able to select the [mobility technology components](definitions.md#mobility_technology_component) that best meet their needs.
5. All individuals should be empowered to find, access, and utilize high-quality mobility options that meet their needs as they see fit, while maintaining their privacy.

## Implementation recommendations

### \>> [Mobility technology components](definitions.md#mobility_technology_component) shall:  

- [x]  Utilize current or proposed [open standards](definitions.md#open_standard) (and its associated best practices) to receive, process, store and export [mobility data](definitions.md#mobility_data).  
- [x]  Where current or proposed* [open standards](definitions.md#open_standard) are not applicable, data schemas and APIs to receive, process, store and export [mobility data](definitions.md#mobility_data) should be compatible* with current or proposed [open standards](definitions.md#open_standard)*, free from cost and restrictions to use, and posted to a public website in human- and the appropriate language-neutral, machine-readable format/*.   
- [x]  Allow [mobility providers](#mobility_provider) to, free from cost and without restrictions, download, distribute and [publish](#publish) their data in a [well-documented format](definitions.md#documented_format).  
- [x]  Provide [mobility providers](definitions.md#mobility_provider), and any other parties at the [mobility providers](definitions.md#mobility_provider)â€™' discretion, free from cost and without restrictions, real-time, read/write [fully-capable programmatic access](definitions.md#programmatic_access) to [mobility technology component](definitions.md#mobility_technology_component) data.   
- [x]  Protect individual privacy and anonymity.

### \>> [Transportation technology companies](definitions.md#transportation_technology_company), [mobility providers](definitions.md#mobility_provider), and [transportation system managers](definitions.md#transportation_system_manager) shall: 

- [x]  Collaboratively develop and adopt [open standards](definitions.md#open_standard) where gaps currently exist.  

### \>> [Transportation technology companies](definitions.md#transportation_technology_company)" shall:  

- [x]  Ensure their [mobility technology component](definitions.md#mobility_technology_component) products are consistent with the Principles.

### \>> [Mobility providers](definitions.md#mobility_provider) and [transportation system managers](definitions.md#transportation_system_manager) shall:

- [x]  Requiring compliance with the Principles in procurement of any [mobility technology component](definitions.md#mobility_technology_component).
