# Mobility Data Interoperability Principles

    [Co-signer form](https://forms.gle/TW5f25cUR12GTiCB6) can be submitted on an ongoing basis.

Public Transit, and the mobility services which support it, is a critical backbone to our environmental, economic, and societal well-being.  Modern, easily-accessible and well-operated public transit depends on a complex system of operations and customer-oriented technology components which work together.  

Interoperable transit technology systems enable transit providers to plan service which is responsive to rider needs, improve service quality and efficiency, and adapt to continuing changes.  Interoperability also encourages innovation among transportation technology companies while helping them to contain costs.

The Mobility Data Interoperability Principles, currently in a public draft form, create an industry-agreed upon vision, definition and direction for achieving interoperability with clear roles and responsibilities.  The Draft Principles were collaboratively developed among transit agencies, supporting mobility service providers, local, regional and national governmental bodies, and civil society organizations and are available for public comment and review through September 13th.  

The Principles are co-authored by (in alphabetical order) the California Association of Coordinated Transportation, California Integrated Travel Project, Denver Regional Transportation District,  ENTUR, Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, Metro Transit (MN), the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, MobilityData, the Shared Use Mobility Center, the Taskar Center for Accessible Technology, Tri-Met, VIA Metropolitan Transit San Antonio, and Washington State Department of Transportation Public Transportation Division.  

## Purpose

The purpose of the Mobility Data Interoperability Principles is to foster a transit industry where [mobility data](definitions.md#mobility_data) flows freely and securely between systems](definitions.md#mobility_technology_system), between operators, and between providers and the riding public, **empowering transit agencies and other [mobility service providers](definitions.md#mobility_service_provider) and [transportation system managers](definitions.md#transportation_system_manager) to provide better service, improve the customer experience, and build systems that are equitable and sustainable.**

## Principles

<span class="version-tag">v1.0</span>

The undersigned organizations and individuals support the following Mobility Data Interoperability Principles:

1. All systems creating, modifying, or consuming [mobility data](definitions.md#mobility_data) should be [interoperable](definitions.md#interoperability).  
2. [Interoperability](definitions.md#interoperability) should be achieved through the development, adoption, and widespread implementation of [open standards](definitions.md#open_standard) that support the efficient exchange and portability of [mobility data](definitions.md#mobility_data).  
3. Transit agencies and other [mobility service providers](definitions.md#mobility_service_provider) should have access to tools that present high-quality [mobility data](definitions.md#mobility_data) accessibly, equitably, and in real time to assist travelers in meeting their mobility needs.  
4. Transit agencies, other [mobility service providers](definitions.md#mobility_service_provider), and travellers should be able to select the [transportation technology components](definitions.md#mobility_technology_component) that best meet their needs.  
5. All individuals and the public should be empowered through high-quality, well-distributed [mobility data](definitions.md#mobility_data) to find, access, and utilize high-quality mobility options that meet their needs as they see fit, while maintaining their privacy.
