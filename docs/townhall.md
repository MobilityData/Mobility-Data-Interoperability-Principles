# Town Hall Meeting

You are invited to [join us](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZ0td-6upjMuGtIxsQJMVB92fKvgpIa9XDea) on **Thursday, December 9 at 11 a.m. Pacific** for the first [Mobility Data Interoperability Principles](index.md) (MDIP) townhall. MDIP is an ambitious effort to accelerate the implementation, adoption, and creation of open standards for mobility data by bringing together these groups:

- mobility service providers (transit agencies and other companies who provide rides),  
- transportation technology companies (software or hardware vendors),research institutions,  
- transportation system managers (DOTs and other regulators oftransportation infrastructure), and  
- the public.  

This session is designed to provide answers to common questions that the co-authors have received about MDIP and to give an opportunity for additional discussion about near-term actions that can be taken to achieve the vision laid out in MDIP. Regardless if you are already among the co-signers or if this is your first time hearing about the project, this session will help you figure out where you fit in to MDIP.

Attendees will gain a better understanding of:

- The objectives that MDIP is seeking to achieve,  
- Why MDIP is the right tool to achieve our objectives,  
- What practical steps co-signers should expect to take in support of MDIP, and  
- What resources are (or will be) available to co-signers to help us all succeed together.

The session will run about 90 minutes and is free and open to attend. Please add or pass this invitation along to others within your firm or outside of it if you feel they would benefit from attending.
