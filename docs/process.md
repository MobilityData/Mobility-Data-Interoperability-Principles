## Initial Development
The initial development of the Principles includes the following stages discussed below in more detail:

1. [Admin Draft Process](#Admin_Draft_Process) (early summer 2021),   
2. [Public Review Process](#Public_Review_Process) (late summer 2021),  
3. [Version 1.0 Release](#Version_1.0_Process) (early fall 2021), and  

### Admin Draft Process
The Admin draft was co-authored by numerous individuals and organizations who worked together throughout June and July to release a public draft by August where they were allowed some time to decide if they wanted to publicly support the Principles as a co-signer or co-author or remain private.  Issues addressed in the admin draft process included:

 - Purpose and need,  
 - Use cases,  
 - Scope bounding,  
 - Vision, and   
 - Organization and governance.

## Ongoing Governance
Changes to the Principles will be evaluated by the co-authors on a regular basis.  If consensus cannot be reached among the co-authors, changes will be raised to a majority vote. Co-authors will consider that changes may affect the co-signers’ willingness to continue their support.  

Ongoing management and leadership of the Principles is an ongoing discussion among the co-authors and co-signers as is a process by which to admit additional co-authors subsequent to the public-draft release.
