## Implementation Recommendations

The following defines the implementation responsibilities, agreed to by the Mobility Data Interoperability Principles’ co-signers, which are required to comply with the the intent of the Mobility Data Interoperability Principles. Note that several of these responsibilities will be dependent upon the implementation resources discussed in the following section. 

### \>> [transportation technology components](definitions.md#transportation_technology_component) shall:  

- [x]  Utilize current or proposed [open standards](definitions.md#open_standard)  (along with associated best practices) to receive, process, store and export [mobility data](definitions.md#mobility_data).  
- [x]  Where neither [open standards](definitions.md#open_standard) nor proposed open standards are yet available, data schemas and APIs to receive, process, store and export [mobility data](definitions.md#mobility_data) shall be compatible with open standards and/or proposed [open standards](definitions.md#open_standard) , free from cost and restrictions to use, and posted to a public website in human- and the appropriate language-neutral, machine-readable format.   
- [x]  Allow transit agencies and other [mobility service providers](definitions.md#mobility_provider) to, free from cost and without restrictions, download, distribute and [publish](definitions.md#publish) their data in a [well-documented format](definitions.md#documented_format).  
- [x]  Provide transit agencies and other [mobility service providers](definitions.md#mobility_provider) and any other parties at their discretion, free from cost and without restrictions, real-time, read/write [fully-capable programmatic access](definitions.md#programmatic_access) to [mobility data](definitions.md#mobility_data).
- [x]  Protect individual privacy and anonymity. 

### \>> [Transportation technology companies](definitions.md#transportation_technology_company), [mobility service providers](definitions.md#mobility_provider), and [transportation system managers](definitions.md#transportation_system_manager) shall: 

- [x]  Collaboratively develop and adopt open standards where gaps currently exist.

### \>> [Transportation technology companies](definitions.md#transportation_technology_company), transit agencies, [mobility service providers](definitions.md#mobility_provider), and [transportation system managers](definitions.md#transportation_system_manager) shall: 

- [x]  Collaboratively develop and adopt [open standards](definitions.md#open_standard) where gaps currently exist.  

### \>> [Transportation technology companies](definitions.md#transportation_technology_company)" shall:  

- [x]  Ensure the products they provide to transit providers are consistent with the Principles.

### \>> [Mobility providers](definitions.md#mobility_provider) and [transportation system managers](definitions.md#transportation_system_manager) shall:

- [x]  Require compliance with the Principles in procurement of any [transit technology component](definitions.md#transit_technology_component).


## Implementation Resources

We have developed initial versions of the following implementation resources to coincide with the release of the Public Draft. These will continue to be refined as version 1.0 is finalized. 

| With Public Draft | |
| :--- | :--- |
|Stand-alone website | For the purposes of the draft, we will use the following web property: [https://interoperable-mobility.github.io/principles/] <br> Includes: <br> - White paper content as a website <br> -Signatories and co-authors <br> -Process for becoming a signatory and co-author |
| TRB Paper | [Submitted for review.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11FqH4p2l2VCIxdWWq8jSXwmnULt2aOFr/view) |
