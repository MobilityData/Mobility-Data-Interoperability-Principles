# Implementation

While MDIP's most immediate goal is building and demonstrating the consensus for interoperability in the transit industry, the coalition is aware that the measure of that consensus will be the concrete changes that come from it. The Principles cannot succeed unless th

## Implementation Responsibilities
The following table defines the implementation responsibilities, agreed to by the Mobility Data Interoperability Principlesâ€™ co-signers, which are required to comply with the intent of the Mobility Data Interoperability Principles. Note that several of these responsibilities will be dependent upon the implementation resources discussed in the following section.  

### \>> [Mobility technology components](definitions.md#mobility_technology_component) shall  

- [x]  Explicitly state that transit agencies or other [mobility service providers](definitions.md#mobility_service_provider) own [mobility data](definitions.md#mobility_data) produced by their respective mobility technology components.  
- [x]  Utilize current or proposed open standards (along with associated best practices) to receive, process, store and export [mobility data](definitions.md#mobility_data).  
- [x]  Where neither open standards nor proposed open standards are yet available, data schemas and APIs to receive, process, store and export [mobility data](definitions.md#mobility_data) shall be compatible with [open standards](definitions.md#open_standard) and/or proposed open standards, free from cost and restrictions to use, and posted to a public website in human- and the appropriate language-neutral, machine-readable format.  
- [x]  Allow transit agencies and other [mobility service providers](definitions.md#mobility_service_provider) to, free from cost and without restrictions, download, distribute and publish data owned by that agency or service provider in a well-documented format.  
- [x]  Provide transit agencies and other [mobility service providers](definitions.md#mobility_service_provider) and any other parties at their discretion, free from cost and without restrictions, real-time, read-only or read/write fully-capable programmatic access to [mobility data](definitions.md#mobility_data) owned by that agency or service provider, including geospatial data (e.g. GIS files).  
- [x]  Protect individual privacy and anonymity.  

### \>> [Transportation technology companies](definitions.md#transportation_technology_company), [mobility service providers](definitions.md#mobility_service_provider), and [transportation system managers](definitions.md#transportation_system_manager) shall

- [x]  Collaboratively develop and adopt [open standards](definitions.md#open_standard) where gaps currently exist.  

### \>> [Transportation technology companies](definitions.md#transportation_technology_company) shall  

- [x]  Ensure the products they provide to transit providers are consistent with the Principles.

### \>> [Mobility providers](definitions.md#mobility_service_provider) and [transportation system managers](definitions.md#transportation_system_manager) shall

- [x]  Require compliance with the Principles in procurement of any [transit technology components](definitions.md#transit_technology_component).  

## Implementation Resources

We developed initial versions of the following implementation resources coinciding with the release of the Public Draft.  

| With Public Draft | |
| :--- | :--- |
|Stand-alone website | For the purposes of the draft, we will use the following web property: [https://interoperable-mobility.github.io/principles/] <br> Includes: <br> - White paper content as a website <br> -Signatories and co-authors <br> -Process for becoming a signatory and co-author |
| TRB Paper | [Submitted for review,](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11FqH4p2l2VCIxdWWq8jSXwmnULt2aOFr/view) but not accepted. |

| [White paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SnzVfsD_hN1GegdJBv8iTheZ2kf6Rejd5--k7W5jTh4/edit?usp=sharing) | White paper as a stand-alone document. |

The following resources will be available alongside version 1.0 (or soon after its release) in order to support Principle implementation.  

| With Version 1.0 | |
| :--- | :--- |
| Graphic identity |  To solidify the principles as a unique and cohesive group which extends between the confines of any single organization. |
