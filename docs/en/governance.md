# MDIP Project Governance

!!! tip

    When capitalized in this document, the words “MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" refer to their respective definitions in RFC 2119.

This document outlines the roles, policies, procedures, and structures that guide the collaborative and transparent stewardship of the Mobility Data Interoperability Principles  (“MDIP”) Project. The MDIP Project is a collaborative effort by government agencies, mobility service providers, and nonprofit organizations that are dedicated to changing the relationship between transit and technology. MDIP establishes a vision for the transit industry in which all mobility data is communicated by interoperable technology components using open standards. Interoperability is the next step for the software and hardware that support transit operations, planning, reporting, and the rider experience. It is a necessary condition for transit to keep pace with the changing world of personal mobility and to develop service that meets the expectations of the riding public.
