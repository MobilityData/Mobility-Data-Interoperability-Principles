# Town Hall Meeting

The co-author coalition held a Town Hall meeting on Thursday, December 9 at 11 a.m. Pacific for the first [Mobility Data Interoperability Principles](index.md) (MDIP). MDIP is an ambitious effort to accelerate the implementation, adoption, and creation of open standards for mobility data by bringing together these groups:

- mobility service providers (transit agencies and other companies who provide rides),  
- transportation technology companies (software or hardware vendors),research institutions,  
- transportation system managers (DOTs and other regulators of transportation infrastructure), and  
- the public.  

[You can now watch the full meeting here](resources.md).

The session was designed to provide answers to common questions that the co-authors have received about MDIP and to give an opportunity for additional discussion about near-term actions that can be taken to achieve the vision laid out in MDIP. Regardless if you are already among the co-signers or if this is your first time hearing about the project, this session will help you figure out where you fit in to MDIP.

Attendees will gain a better understanding of:

- The objectives that MDIP is seeking to achieve,  
- Why MDIP is the right tool to achieve our objectives,  
- What practical steps co-signers should expect to take in support of MDIP, and  
- What resources are (or will be) available to co-signers to help us all succeed together.

The session is about 90 minutes.
