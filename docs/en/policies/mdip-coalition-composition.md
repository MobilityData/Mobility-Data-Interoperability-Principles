- Indication of a desire to become a Member to the [MDIP Program Manager](../governance.md/#mdip-program-manager) or an existing Member;
- Written indiciation of their commitment to realizing the vision of the Principles to the [MDIP Program Manager](../governance.md/#mdip-program-manager);

- A Member or the [MDIP Manager](../governance.md/#mdip-manager) MUST request their removal in writing to the [MDIP Coalition Chair](../governance.md#mdip-coalition-chair) which includes the reasoning;
- The Member in question MUST be given an opportunity to remedy the situation (e.g. selecting a different [MDIP Coalition Organizational Representative](../governance.md#mdip-coalition-organizational-representative)); and
- The [MDIP Coalition](../governance.md#mdip-coalition) MUST approve of the removal following the Member’s opportunity to remedy the cause.
