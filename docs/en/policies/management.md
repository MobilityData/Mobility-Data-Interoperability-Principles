# Management

## Appointment

The [MDIP Coalition](../governance.md/#mdip-coalition) SHOULD appoint an individual or organization to serve as the [MDIP Manager](../governance.md/#mdip-manager). In order to appoint an [MDIP Manager](../governance.md/#mdip-manager), the [MDIP Coalition](../governance.md/#mdip-coalition) MUST execute a memorandum of understanding with that organization or individual which recognizes them in that role and articulates the expectations of both parties and the period of performance.

## Severance

If the [MDIP Manager](../governance.md/#mdip-manager) fails to serve adequately in the role, the [MDIP Coalition](../governance.md/#mdip-coalition) SHOULD seek a remedy through:

- First discussing specific concerns with the [MDIP Manager](../governance.md/#mdip-manager)to resolve any miscommunication about role responsibilities;
- If the concerns remain outstanding, mutually agree to a performance improvement plan with specific performance milestones over a period not to exceed three months; and
- If the milestones are not met, explore termination of the organization or individual in fulfilling the [MDIP Manager](../governance.md/#mdip-manager) role.

The [MDIP Coalition](../governance.md/#mdip-coalition) SHOULD provide as much financial or in-kind support as is practicable to the [MDIP Manager](../governance.md/#mdip-manager) in supporting the activities articulated in the MDIP Roadmap including identifying and helping secure grants, memberships, and direct financial support.
