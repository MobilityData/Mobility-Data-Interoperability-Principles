### Media Blurb

The [Mobility Data Interoperability Principles](http://interoperablemobility.org) provide clear objectives and implementation actions for the public and private sectors in order to make the critical connection between transit technology systems and better service. The Principles were developed collaboratively by dozens of public and private organizations and researchers and are supported by over 60 signatories, who have committed to their implementation.
