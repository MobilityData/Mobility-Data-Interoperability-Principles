The Mobility Data Interoperability Principles were developed by [ list of all co-authors ] with the help and review of the organizations listed below. 


## Background
The mobility landscape is complex. People have individualized mobility needs that shape preferences around where, when, and how they travel. Mobility providers, likewise, are extremely varied. The variety among mobility providers creates an opportunity for more people to have their mobility needs better met, but fulfilling this promise requires a level of inter-platform interoperability and coordination within and between mobility providers and cooperation between mobility providers and transportation technology companies that is yet to be realized in order to achieve true Mobility as a Service (MaaS).

Over the course of the last decade, passengers have enjoyed increased access to mobile apps and real-time information to help them choose the trips that are right for them, but still lack a complete picture of their available options because of technical- and political information silos – not to mention unequal access to technology. Nonetheless, expectations have risen, as real-time transit information, on-demand ride hailing, and micromobility options become embedded in daily life.

## Vision
More than ever, meeting the needs of travelers requires the complete interoperability of mobility data used by transit providers and transportation technology companies.

**All people** can, equitably:  

  - Obtain the highest possible quality of access to information about the mobility options that exist in their area without barriers,  
  - Access the information they need to make informed choices about their mobility options in real-time,   
  - Maintain their privacy and security,  
  - Enjoy seamless personal mobility regardless of where they are and the combination of modes they choose to meet their needs.

**[Mobility providers](definitions.md#mobility_provider)** can:   

  - Interface with other [mobility providers](#mobility_provider) to meet riders needsMaximize their ability to serve all or part of a rider’s trip,  
  - Use the best available data to support analytics and real-time decision-making for their planning, scheduling, and operating needs,  
  - Select the best available technology and equipment to provide their service without vendor lock-in, and  
  - Easily use their data and data from other [mobility providers](#mobility_provider) to increase rider satisfaction and the customer experience through service efficiency and service quality.

**[Transportation technology companies](definitions.md#transportation_technology_company)** can:  

  - Develop new and innovative approaches to serving the needs of [mobility providers](definitions.md#mobility_provider) and riders,   
  - Use widely-adopted [open standards](#open_standard) for the transmission of all data that allows [mobility providers](index.md#mobility_provider) and riders to meet their needs,  
Easily integrate with other companies’s hardware and software to send and receive planning, scheduling, and operating data, and  
  - Quickly identify and resolve data issues with their product.

**Researchers** can: 

  - Affordably process, and use data from a variety of [mobility technology components](definitions.md#mobility_technology_component) without having to re-create data processing pipelines or obtain costly vendor licenses.   

**[Transportation System Managers](definitions.md#transportation_system_manager)** can

  - Easily access mobility operations and traveler needs at a system level across [mobility providers](definitions.md#mobility_provider) and jurisdictions in order to inform short- and long-range strategies and policy,  
  - Support the above visions. 

## What is interoperability?
Interoperability is the ability for systems to natively exchange data in a format that each can understand. Interoperability is:

 - Travelers being shown all relevant mobility options along with their time, reliability and costs in their trip planning application of their choice, because mobility service providers publish their availability using open standards. 
 - Any trip planning application being used by a traveler to figure out when their bus will arrive understands the information published about the bus’ location. 
 - A transit planner understanding the needs and experiences of riders in order to plan future service by having their transit planning applications (i.e. scheduling software) able to directly  use ridership, MDT, and location data from on-board hardware.
 - Mobility service providers easily changing which GPS unit their CAD/AVL system uses because the old and new GPS units transmit data in an open standard and the CAD/AVL system ingests data in an open standard.
 - Mobility service providers inserting or merging service alerts generated from one system into another.
 - A service planner for a mobility service provider expressing service detours to their arrival prediction software, the public, and other mobility service providers in an open standard from the same,  reliable source.
 - A trip planning application, a mobility service provider, and a transportation system manager querying information about road closures in an open standard from the same source. 
Transportation system managers are able to easily aggregate demand data from mobility service providers because it is available in an open standard.  

In short, interoperability means everyone in the mobility industry can speak the same language when it comes to mobility data.

## Why is interoperability important?
The easiest way to see the importance of interoperability is to look at what happens when interoperability isn’t present. Currently, transportation tech companies have built proprietary ways of representing information that likely are similar to, but slightly different from, those used by other companies. In order to communicate with any other device, their applications have to be programmed, generally at additional expense, to understand one another. In many cases, this additional expense or hassle is replaced with countless staff hours doing double- and in some cases triple data-entry.  The common results in either case are:

 - mobility service providers encountering an extreme amount of friction in order to manage and operate service (especially changes to the service),
 - transportation system managers unable to understand the full picture of the system in a consistent and up-to-date manner, and
 - extreme friction in time and cost in updating and upgrading any technology component to meet new requirements or take advantage of additional innovations. 

The high friction thus results in a technology marketplace where there are minimal incentives for:

 - incumbent transit technology providers to increase interoperability or provide high-quality products and service, and  
 - additional transit technology providers to enter the market.

The impact of the current lack of interoperability is an overall reduction in any party to perform to the best of their ability – the mobility service provider, system managers, and transit technology providers – which results in a poor customer experience. 

An interoperable mobility industry would improve service quality and efficiency. Interoperability would also promote the ability of the transit provider to adapt to continuing changes in the mobility landscape, to more effectively plan service, and to spur innovation among transportation tech companies.

## How do these principles support interoperability?
The Mobility Data Interoperability Principles will help the mobility industry move toward interoperability by encouraging the adoption and implementation of adopted and proposed open standards originating within the industry itself. 

The Interoperability Principles clearly designate the roles that mobility providers and transportation tech companies must play in order to achieve interoperability. 

The Interoperability Principles will also serve as a benchmark for measuring individual organization’s commitment to achieving interoperability.
