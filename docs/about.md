The Mobility Data Interoperability Principles were developed by the above [listed co-authors(index.md#co-authors)] with significant input from generous reviewers in support of a common vision for [interoperability](definitions.md#interoperability)). Additional information about the development process and implementation can be found in its respective section.  

# Context
## Background
The mobility landscape is complex. People have individualized abilities, preferences, and mobility needs that shape preferences around where, when, and how they travel. Transit agencies and other mobility service providers, likewise, are extremely varied. The variety among transit agencies and other mobility service providers creates an opportunity for more people to have their mobility needs better met. But fulfilling this promise requires a level of interoperability and cooperation between transit agencies, other mobility service providers and transportation technology companies that is yet to be realized.

Over the course of the last decade, passengers have enjoyed increased access to mobile apps and real-time information to help them choose the modes, services, and trips that are right for them, but still lack a complete picture of their available options because of technical- and political information silos – not to mention unequal access to technology. Nonetheless, expectations have risen, as real-time transit information, on-demand ride hailing, and micromobility options become embedded in daily life.

More than ever, meeting the needs of travelers requires the complete interoperability of mobility data used by transit agencies, mobility service providers and transportation technology companies.

## Vision
More than ever, meeting the needs of travelers requires the complete interoperability of mobility data used by transit providers and transportation technology companies.

**All people** can, equitably:  

  - Discover and make informed choices about their mobility options in real-time by utilizing the highest possible quality of information with the least possible barriers to accessing that information,   
  - Maintain their privacy and security,    
  - Travel with the minimum possible friction arising from accessing data related to their mode(s) of travel. 

**[Mobility service providers](definitions.md#mobility_provider)** can:   

  - Interface with other mobility providers to meet riders needs,  
  - Use the best available data to support analytics and real-time decision-making for their planning, scheduling, and operating needs,  
  - Select the best available technology and equipment to provide their service without vendor lock-in, and  
  - Easily use their data and data from other mobility providers to increase rider satisfaction and the customer experience through service efficiency and service quality.

**[Transportation technology companies](definitions.md#transportation_technology_company)** can:  

  - Develop new and innovative approaches to serving the needs of mobility service providers and riders,   
  - Use widely-adopted open standards for the transmission of all data that allows mobility service providers and riders to meet their needs,  
  - Easily integrate with other companies’s hardware and software to send and receive planning, scheduling, and operating data, and  
  - Quickly identify and resolve data issues with their product.


**Researchers** can: 

  - Affordably process, and use data from a variety of transportation technology components without having to re-create data processing pipelines or obtain costly vendor licenses.   

**[Transportation System Managers](definitions.md#transportation_system_manager)** can

  - Easily access mobility operations and traveler needs at a system level across transit providers and jurisdictions in order to inform short- and long-range strategies and policy,  
  - Support the above visions. 


## What is interoperability?
 Interoperable technologies can natively exchange data in a format that each can understand. 

 Interoperability enables:

  - Travelers to see all relevant mobility options along with travel time, reliability and cost in their trip planning application of their choice, because mobility service providers publish their availability using open standards.   
  - Trip planning applications to interpret the information published about transit vehicles’s locations.   
  - Transit planners to understand the needs and experiences of riders in order to plan future service by enabling their transit planning applications (i.e. scheduling software) to directly  use ridership, MDT, and location data from on-board hardware.  
  - Mobility service providers to easily change which GPS unit their CAD/AVL system uses because the old and new GPS units transmit data in an open standard and the CAD/AVL system ingests data in an open standard.  
  - Mobility service providers to insert or merge service alerts generated from one system into another.  
  - A service planner for a mobility service provider to notify their arrival prediction software, the public, and other mobility service providers of detours in an open standard from the same, reliable source.  
  - Transportation system managers are able to easily aggregate transportation demand data (e.g. number of intraregional transit trips served in a given month) from mobility service providers because they are available in an open standard.  
  - A transportation technology company to lower development and maintenance costs and increase predictability by having a clear understanding of how to interface with neighboring system components.   
 
In short, interoperability means everyone in the mobility industry can speak the same language when it comes to mobility data.

## Why is interoperability important?
The easiest way to see the importance of interoperability is to look at what happens when interoperability isn’t present. Currently, transportation technology companies have built proprietary ways of representing information that likely are similar to, but slightly different from, those used by other companies. In order to communicate with any other device, their applications have to be programmed, generally at additional expense, to understand one another. In many cases, this additional expense or hassle is replaced with countless staff hours doing double- and in some cases triple data-entry.  The common results in either case are:

 - Transit agencies and other mobility service providers encountering an extreme amount of friction in order to manage and operate service (especially changes to the service),  
 - Transportation system managers being unable to understand the full picture of the system in a consistent and up-to-date manner,  
 - Transit agencies and other mobility service providers experience difficulty accessing and aggregating the information they need to assess how the system they fund actually functions, and  
 - Extreme friction in time and cost in updating and upgrading any technology component to meet new requirements or take advantage of additional innovations. 

The high friction thus results in a technology marketplace where there are minimal incentives for:

 - Incumbent transit technology providers to increase interoperability or innovate high-quality products and service, and  
 - Additional transit technology providers to enter the market.

The impact of the current lack of interoperability is an overall reduction in any party to perform to the best of their ability – the mobility service providers transportation system managers, and transportation technology companies– which results in a poor customer experience and an overall loss to a society in which greater transit utilization is a necessary step to fighting climate change. 

An interoperable mobility industry would improve service quality and efficiency. Interoperability would also promote the ability of the transit provider to adapt to continuing changes in the mobility landscape, to more effectively plan service, and to spur innovation among transportation technology companies while helping them to contain costs.

## How do these principles support interoperability?
The Mobility Data Interoperability Principles will help the transit industry and other mobility service providers move toward interoperability by encouraging the adoption and implementation of adopted and proposed open standards originating within the industry itself. 

The Mobility Data Interoperability Principles will clearly designate the roles that mobility providers and transportation tech companies must play in order to achieve interoperability. The Mobility Data Interoperability Principles will also serve as a benchmark for measuring individual organization’s commitment to achieving interoperability.
