## Optimizing Images for the Website

When adding or updating images such as logos on the website, they should be optimized _before_ they are committed_; meaning they should be stripped of metadata and other information reducing the file size allowing them to load faster for users. There are two tools that can be used for this,

- [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) - a web browser based image optimizer; use the OxiPNG option for PNGs
- [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac) - a macOS application that will take care of choosing the best algorithm
