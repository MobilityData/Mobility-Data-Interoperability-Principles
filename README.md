# Mobility Data Interoperability Principles

Public Transit, and the mobility services which support it, is a critical backbone to our environmental, economic, and societal well-being.  Modern, easily-accessible and well-operated public transit depends on a complex system of operations and customer-oriented technology components which work together.  

Interoperable transit technology systems enable transit providers to plan service which is responsive to rider needs, improve service quality and efficiency, and adapt to continuing changes.  Interoperability also encourages innovation among transportation technology companies while helping them to contain costs.

The [Mobility Data Interoperability Principles](https://interoperable-mobility.github.io/principles), currently in a public draft form, create an industry-agreed upon vision, definition and direction for achieving interoperability with clear roles and responsibilities.  The Draft Principles were collaboratively developed among transit agencies, supporting mobility service providers, local, regional and national governmental bodies, and civil society organizations and are available for public comment and review through September 13th.
